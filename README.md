## ***Issue Reporting Guideline***

To maintain an effective bugfix workflow and make sure issues will be solved, I ask reporters to follow some simple guidelines.

Before creating an issue, please do the following:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` in the repository.
3. Make sure, that information you are about to report is related to this repository 
   and not the one available ***Python's repository***, Because this repository cannot be downloaded via pip.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What was the course url? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS
experience the problem? All these details will help to fix any potential bugs as soon as possible.

### ***Example:***

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a lynda course link to reproduce the error.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported.
